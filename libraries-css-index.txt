âœ… ESSENTIAL LIBRARIES:

- FontAwesome 4.7.0: Standard icon library
- Owl Carousel: Content slider functionality
- Lightbox plugins: Image viewing experience

ðŸŸ¡ LOGISTICS-RELATED CONTENT:
- Custom icomoon icons include many logistics-specific icons:
  - Delivery trucks, cargo ships, warehouses
  - Forklift, conveyor, package icons
  - These could be replaced with visa-specific icons

ðŸ“Š CONTENT BREAKDOWN:
- Bootstrap Framework: ~85% (essential)
- FontAwesome Icons: ~10% (essential)
- Carousel/Lightbox: ~3% (functional)
- Custom Logistics Icons: ~2% (could be visa-focused)

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

1. KEEP AS-IS:
   - Bootstrap framework (essential for responsive design)
   - FontAwesome icons (standard web icons)
   - Carousel and lightbox functionality

2. CONSIDER REPLACING:
   - Custom icomoon logistics icons with visa-related icons
   - Could add passport, document, globe icons instead of trucks/warehouses

3. NO ISSUES FOUND:
   - All code is standard, minified library code
   - No logistics business logic or content
   - Properly licensed and legitimate libraries

=== VERDICT ===
**STATUS: FUNCTIONAL AND APPROPRIATE**
This file contains only legitimate, standard web development libraries with no business-specific content issues. The logistics icons in the custom font could be updated but are not problematic.
